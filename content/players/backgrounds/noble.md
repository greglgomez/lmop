# Background: Noble
Your family is no stranger to wealth, power and privilege. In the glory days of Neverwinter, your parents were the count and countess of Corlinn Hill, a large estate located in the hills northeast of the city. But Mount Hotenow erupted thirty years ago, devastating Neverwinter and erasing Corlinn Hill from the map. Instead of growing up on an estate, you were raised in a small but comfortable town house in Waterdeep. As an adult, you instead to inhertit a meaningless title and little else.

### Personal Goal: Civilize Phandalin
You were meant for more than being a ruler of nothing at all. Rebuilding Corlinn Hill is impractical, thanks to the volcano. But in the last three or four years, hardy settlers have been rebuilding another ruin near the city: The old town of Phandalin, which orcs sacked five centuries ago. Clearly what Phandalin needs now is a civilizing influence - someone to take the reins and bring law and order. Someone like you.

Youâ€™re not the only one with such ideas. A knight named Sildar Hallwinter recently set out for Phandalin in the company of a Dwarf named Gundren Rockseeker and plan to reclaim an ancient mine and restore Phandalin to a civilized center of wealth and prosperity. Since your goals align, Hallwinter should be willing to assist you.
