# Background: Acolyte
You have spent your life dedicated to Oghma, all seeing god of knowledge, and spent years learning the lore of the multiverse.

### Personal Goal: Reconsecrate the defiled altar
Through visions delivered in your trances, your god has called you to a new mission. A goblin tribe has made its lair in an ancient ruin now called Cragmaw Castle, where they have defiled a shrine once sacred to Oghma. Now dedicated to the vile goblin god Maglubiyet, the altar is an offense to Oghma that must not stand. You’re sure Oghma has greater things in store for you if you can complete this task. In the meantime, your visions suggest that Sister Garaele - a Priest of Tymora, the Goddess of Luck - can aid you in the town of Phandalin.
