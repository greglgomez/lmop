# Background: Soldier
Trained as a soldier on the island of Mintarn, you traveled to Neverwinter as part of a mercenary company that serves as both army and city watch. You grew disillusioned with your fellow soldiers, who seem to enjoy their authority at the expense of the people they’re supposed to protect.

### Personal Goal: Teach the Redbrands a lesson
You’ve heard that Daran Edermath in the town of Phandalin is looking for people of courage and principle to teach some bullies a lesson. These thugs, the Redbrands, have been throwing their weight around Phandalin, much as your compatriots did in Neverwinter. Putting a stop to their villainy is a worthy goal.
